Due to biological characteristics such as unstable activity of traditional antibodies or protein macromolecules, the administration of biopharmaceuticals is basically limited to injections.

The three-dimensional structure of nanobodies determines the relative stability of their structure and biological activity and their biological properties. Nanobodies have the characteristics of high temperature resistance, activity in a certain acid-base environment, good water solubility, and strong tissue penetration. Therefore, by optimizing the formulation of the carrier, the stability of the nanobody and the penetration of the skin tissue can be maintained and increased, so as to achieve a transdermal delivery formulation of the nanobody biopharmaceutical. The transdermal delivery of nanobody can be used for the specific nanobody to play a role in the local application area, and can also be used for the nanobody to penetrate the skin and enter the blood circulation to reach the site of a predetermined lesion. Nanobodies in the transdermal delivery system include specific nanobodies for different lesion targets, such as, but not limited to, dermatological targets, inflammation and rheumatism targets, cancer targets, viral bacteria targets, cardiovascular disease targets, diabetes targets, Alzheimer's disease targets, brain tumor targets. The carrier for transdermal delivery of the nanobody has the advantages of stabilizing the structure and efficacy of the nanobody, releasing the drug via the skin, and having good transdermal effect; the comfort of skin application is high; and the skin irritation and allergic reaction characteristics are basically absent. The carrier system components include, but not limited to, soluble polymer macromolecular carbohydrate matrix, polyethylene glycol (PEG), dextran, polyamino acid, optimized formulation, stirred mixture. The invention discloses a preparation method and application of the transdermal drug delivery system. Transdermal administration is a safe and effective method of administration. Less content of proteolytic enzymes in the skin tissue is conducive to maintaining the stability of such biological drugs. The nanobody biomedical transdermal drug delivery preparation system has the advantages of being non-toxic, stable, controllable, convenient for administration, and easy to operate, etc., and opens up new dosage forms of nanobody biopharmaceuticals, and its application prospect is very broad.
57710820	traditional antibody,peg,high molecular protein,glycerin,hydrolase	US20190338044	NANOBODY VAGINAL ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM AND PREPARATION METHOD AND USE THEREOF	The invention discloses a scheme for preparing some specific nanobody system and delivering nanobody medicine through woman's vagina as well as its preparation method and applications. Women's vagina is rich of capillaries and lymphatic vessels, vaginal permeability is greater than the rectum, mouth, and skin.

Nanobodies are the smallest units known to bind target antigens. The three-dimensional structure of nanobodies determines its relative stable biological activity, also nanobody has the characteristics of high temperature resistance, acid-base resistance, good water-solubility and strong tissue penetration. Thus, a wide range of applications of the Nanobody delivery system in disease treatment and women's health care can be achieved by optimizing carrier formulation to maintain and enhance the stability and tissue penetration of the nanobody, Vaginal nanobody formulations include: creams, crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol (PEG) hydrophilic gels, vaginal gels, vaginal capsules and tablets, vaginal suppositories, vaginal rings, and vaginal film. Nanobody vaginal administration can be used for specific nanobody in the local application, also can be used to penetrate the vaginal mucosa into the bloodstream to reach the preset lesion site to play a role. The vaginal delivery system includes specific nanobodies directly against different target sites of disease, such as local targets include: vaginal infections, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and contraception, while systemic targets include inflammation and Rheumatism, cancer, viral bacteria, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, but the target sites of the vaginal administration of the nanobody is not limited thereto. The composition for vaginal administration of the nanobody includes, but not limited to, soluble macromolecular glycogel matrix, polyethylene glycol (PEG), levoglucose, polyamino acid, glycerin, and stirring and mixing with optimized formulation of hydrolase inhibitor. The invention discloses a preparation method and application of a nanobody vaginal delivery system, a safe and effective administration model, develops a new form of nanobody biomedicine and has a wide application prospect.
