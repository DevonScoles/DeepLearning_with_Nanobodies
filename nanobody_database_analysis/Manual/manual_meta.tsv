The Spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) mediates this key event and thus is a primary target for therapeutic neutralizing antibodies to mask the ACE2-interacting interface. Here, we generated 99 synthetic nanobodies (sybodies) using ribosome and phage display. The best sybody MR3 binds the RBD with K D of 1.0 nM and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with IC50 of 0.40 \u03bcg mL-1. Crystal structures of two sybody-RBD complexes reveal a common neutralizing mechanism through which the RBD-ACE2 interaction is competitively inhibited by sybodies. The structures allowed the rational design of a mutant with higher affinity and improved neutralization efficiency by \u223c24-folds, lowering the IC50 from 12.32 to 0.50 \u03bcg mL-1. Further, the structures explain the selectivity of sybodies between SARS-CoV strains. Our work presents an alternative approach to generate neutralizers against newly emerged viruses.\n\nOne sentence summary Structural and biochemical studies revealed the molecular basis for the neutralization mechanism of in vitro -selected and rationally designed nanobody neutralizers for SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus.\n\n### Competing Interest Statement\n\nThe authors have declared no competing interest."

The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, combined with a lack of population immunity and prevalence of severe clinical outcomes, urges the rapid development of effective therapeutic countermeasures. Here, we report the generation of synthetic nanobodies, known as sybodies, against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. In an expeditious process taking only twelve working days, sybodies were selected entirely in vitro from three large combinatorial libraries, using ribosome and phage display. We obtained six strongly enriched sybody pools against the isolated RBD and identified 63 unique anti-RBD sybodies which also interact in the context of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain. Among the selected sybodies, six were found to bind to the viral spike with double-digit nanomolar affinity, and five of these also showed substantial inhibition of RBD interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Additionally, we identified a pair of anti-RBD sybodies that can simultaneously bind to the RBD. It is anticipated that compact binders such as these sybodies could feasibly be developed into an inhalable drug that can be used as a convenient prophylaxis against COVID-19. Moreover, generation of polyvalent antivirals, via fusion of anti-RBD sybodies to additional small binders recognizing secondary epitopes, could enhance the therapeutic potential and guard against escape mutants. We present full sequence information and detailed protocols for the identified sybodies, as a freely accessible resource.\n\n### Competing Interest Statement\n\nIwan Zimmermann, Pascal Egloff and Markus A.

Neutralizing antibodies provide efficient blockade for viral infection and are a promising category of biological therapies. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) as a bait, we generate a panel of humanized single domain antibodies (sdAbs) from a synthetic library. These sdAbs reveal binding kinetics with the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 0.99\u201335.5\u2009nM. The monomeric sdAbs show half maximal neutralization concentration (EC50) of 0.0009\u20130.07\u2009\u00b5g/mL and 0.13\u20130.51\u2009\u00b5g/mL against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes, and authentic SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Competitive ligand-binding experiments suggest that the sdAbs either completely block or significantly inhibit the association between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and viral entry receptor ACE2. Fusion of the human IgG1 Fc to sdAbs improve their neutralization activity by up to ten times. These results support neutralizing sdAbs as a potential alternative for antiviral therapies. Here, using a humanized phage display library with recombinant SARS- CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins, the authors identify a number of single domain antibodies (sdAbs) that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by inhibiting the interaction of the RDB with the host entry receptor ACE2."

Being a large, multidomain, transmembrane protein, Nsp3 has been the most challenging Nsp to characterize. Encoded within Nsp3 is the papain-like protease PLpro domain that cleaves not only the viral protein but also polyubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15 from host cells. We here compare the interactors of PLpro and Nsp3 and find a largely overlapping interactome. Intriguingly, we find that near full length Nsp3 is a more active protease compared to the minimal catalytic domain of PLpro. Using a MALDI-TOF based assay, we screen 1971 approved clinical compounds and identify five compounds that inhibit PLpro with IC50s in the low micromolar range but showed cross reactivity with other human deubiquitinases and had no significant antiviral activity in cellular SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. We therefore looked for alternative methods to block PLpro activity and engineered competitive nanobodies that bind to PLpro at the substrate binding site with nanomolar affinity thus inhibiting the enzyme. Our work highlights the importance of studying Nsp3 and provides tools and valuable insights to investigate Nsp3 biology during the viral infection cycle.\n\n### Competing Interest Statement\n\nThe authors have declared no competing interest."

By contrast, single-domain antibodies called nanobodies can be produced in bacteria or yeast, and their stability may enable aerosol delivery. Two papers now report nanobodies that bind tightly to spike and efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in cells. Schoof et al. screened a yeast surface display of synthetic nanobodies and Xiang et al. screened anti-spike nanobodies produced by a llama. Both groups identified highly potent nanobodies that lock the spike protein in an inactive conformation. Multivalent constructs of selected nanobodies achieved even more potent neutralization.\n\nScience , this issue p. [1473][1], p. [1479][2]\n\nCost-effective, efficacious therapeutics are urgently needed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we used camelid immunization and proteomics to identify a large repertoire of highly potent neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). We discovered Nbs with picomolar to femtomolar affinities that inhibit viral infection at concentrations below the nanograms-per-milliliter level, and we determined a structure of one of the most potent Nbs in complex with the RBD. Structural proteomics and integrative modeling revealed multiple distinct and nonoverlapping epitopes and indicated an array of potential neutralization mechanisms. We bioengineered multivalent Nb constructs that achieved ultrahigh neutralization potency (half-maximal inhibitory concentration as low as 0.058 ng/ml) and may prevent mutational escape. These thermostable Nbs can be rapidly produced in bulk from microbes and resist lyophilization and aerosolization.\n\n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abe3255\n [2]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abe4747"

In contrast to humans, MERS-CoV\u2013exposed dromedaries develop only very mild infections and exceptionally potent virus-neutralizing antibody responses. These strong antibody responses may be caused by affinity maturation as a result of repeated exposure to the virus or by the fact that dromedaries\u2014apart from conventional antibodies\u2014have relatively unique, heavy chain\u2013only antibodies (HCAbs). These HCAbs are devoid of light chains and have long complementarity-determining regions with unique epitope binding properties, allowing them to recognize and bind with high affinity to epitopes not recognized by conventional antibodies. Through direct cloning and expression of the variable heavy chains (VHHs) of HCAbs from the bone marrow of MERS-CoV\u2013infected dromedaries, we identified several MERS-CoV\u2013specific VHHs or nanobodies. In vitro, these VHHs efficiently blocked virus entry at picomolar concentrations. The selected VHHs bind with exceptionally high affinity to the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein. Furthermore, camel/human chimeric HCAbs\u2014composed of the camel VHH linked to a human Fc domain lacking the CH1 exon\u2014had an extended half-life in the serum and protected mice against a lethal MERS-CoV challenge.

However, animal immunization is inherently slow, has poor compatibility with certain antigens ( e . g ., integral membrane proteins), and suffers from self-tolerance and immunodominance, which limit the functional spectrum of antibodies that can be obtained. Here, we describe Autonomous Hypermutation yEast surfAce Display (AHEAD), a synthetic recombinant antibody generation technology that imitates somatic hypermutation inside engineered yeast. In AHEAD, antibody fragments are encoded on an error-prone orthogonal DNA replication system, resulting in Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations that continuously mutate surface-displayed antibody repertoires. Simple cycles of yeast culturing and enrichment for antigen binding drive the evolution of high-affinity antibody clones in a readily parallelizable process that takes as little as 2 weeks. We applied AHEAD to generate nanobodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, a GPCR, and other targets. The SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies, concurrently evolved from an open-source na\u00efve nanobody library in 8 independent experiments, reached subnanomolar affinities through the sequential fixation of multiple mutations over 3-8 AHEAD cycles that saw \u223c580-fold and \u223c925-fold improvements in binding affinities and pseudovirus neutralization potencies, respectively. These experiments highlight the defining speed, parallelizability, and effectiveness of AHEAD and provide a template for streamlined antibody generation at large with salient utility in rapid response to current and future viral outbreaks.\n\n### Competing Interest Statement\n\nProvisional patents have been filed on this work, with A.W., C.M., A.C.K., and C.C.L. as co-inventors.

Non-neutralizing immunoglobulins, however, can exhibit cross-reactivities between 2 or more serotypes, particularly mosaic forms, which can hamper the development of highly specific immunoassays, especially if based on polyclonal antisera. Here we employ facile recombinant antibody technology to subtractively select ligands to each of the 7 BoNT serotypes, resulting in populations with very high specificity for their intended serotype.  Methods and Findings A single llama was immunized with a cocktail of 7 BoNT toxoids to generate a phage display library of single domain antibodies (sdAb, VHH or nanobodies) which were selected on live toxins. Resulting sdAb were capable of detecting both toxin and toxin complex with the best combinations able to detect 100s-10s of pg per 50 \u00b5L sample in a liquid bead array. The most sensitive sdAb were combined in a heptaplex assay to identify each of the BoNT serotypes in buffer and milk and to a lesser extent in carrot juice, orange juice and cola. Several anti-A(1) sdAb recognized A2 complex, showing that subtype cross-reactivity within a serotype was evident. Many of our sdAb could act as both captor and tracer for several toxin and toxin complexes suggesting sdAb can be used as architectural probes to indicate BoNT oligomerisation. Six of 14 anti-A clones exhibited inhibition of SNAP-25 cleavage in the neuro-2A assay indicating some sdAb had toxin neutralizing capabilities. Many sdAb were also shown to be refoldable after exposure to high temperatures in contrast to polyclonal antisera, as monitored by circular dichroism.  Conclusions Our panel of molecularly flexible antibodies should not only serve as a good starting point for ruggedizing assays and inhibitors, but enable the intricate architectures of BoNT toxins and complexes to be probed more extensively."

Recently, an IgG antibody targeting the external binding protein of the Staphylococcus aureus Mn(II) ABC importer was reported to inhibit transport activity and reduce bacterial cell growth. We here explored the possibility of using alpaca-derived nanobodies to inhibit the vitamin B12 transporter of Escherichia coli, BtuCD-F, as a model system by generating nanobodies against the periplasmic binding protein BtuF. We isolated six nanobodies that competed with B12 for binding to BtuF, with inhibition constants between 10\u22126 and 10\u22129\u2009M. Kinetic characterization of the nanobody-BtuF interactions revealed dissociation half-lives between 1.6 and 6\u2009minutes and fast association rates between 104 and 106\u2009M\u22121s\u22121. For the tightest-binding nanobody, we observed a reduction of in vitro transport activity of BtuCD-F when an excess of nanobody over B12 was used. The structure of BtuF in complex with the most effective nanobody Nb9 revealed the molecular basis of its inhibitory function.

Here, we constructed the phage display vector pCANTAB 5E-VHH and then transformed it into Escherichia coli TG1-competent cells, to construct an initial anti-BVDV nanobody gene library. We obtained a BVDV-E2 antigen epitope bait protein by prokaryotic expression using the nucleotide sequence of the E2 gene of the BVDV-NADL strain published in GenBank. Phage display was used to screen the anti-BVDV nanobody gene library. We successfully constructed a high quality phage display nanobody library, with an initial library capacity of 4.32\u00d7105. After the rescue of helper phage, the titer of the phage display nanobody library was 1.3\u00d71011. The BVDV-E2 protein was then expressed in Escherichia coli (DE3), and a 49.5 kDa band was observed with SDS-PAGE analysis that was consistent with the expected nanobody size. Thus, we were able to isolate one nanobody that exhibits high affinity and specificity against BVDV using phage display techniques. This isolated nanobody was then used in Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay and qRT-PCR, and ELISA analyses of BVDV infection of MDBK cells indicated that the nanobodies exhibited good antiviral effect."

This study expands the applicability of ADAPT to single-domain antibodies (sdAbs), a promising class of recombinant antibody-based biologics. As a test case, we used the camelid\u00a0sdAb A26.8, a VHH that binds Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA) relatively weakly but displays a reasonable level of TcdA neutralization. ADAPT-guided A26.8 affinity maturation resulted in an improvement of one order of magnitude by point mutations only, reaching an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 2\u2009nM, with the best binding mutants having similar or improved stabilities relative to the parent sdAb. This affinity improvement generated a 6-fold enhancement of efficacy at the cellular level; the A26.8 double-mutant T56R,T103R neutralizes TcdA cytotoxicity with an IC50 of 12\u2009nM. The designed mutants with increased affinities are predicted to establish novel electrostatic interactions with the antigen. Almost full additivity of mutation effects is observed, except for positively charged residues introduced at adjacent positions. Furthermore, analysis of false-positive predictions points to general directions for improving the ADAPT\u00a0platform.

Prophylaxis for Argentine Haemorrhagic Fever (AHF), caused by the arenavirus Jun\u00edn (JUNV), has been achieved by the use of a live attenuated vaccine, named Candid#1. The standard treatment of AHF is transfusion of convalescent human plasma. Our aim was to develop an alternative and safer treatment for AHF based on the use of virus-neutralizing single domain antibodies (VHHs). We describe the first reported VHHs directed against an arenavirus. These VHHs could neutralize Candid#1 by altering virion binding/fusion. Surprisingly, the neutralizing VHHs appeared to be specific for the viral nucleoprotein (N) that is not known to be involved in arenavirus entry. Candid#1 VHH-escape viruses had acquired a predicted N-glycosylation site in the surface glycoprotein GP1 that is present in highly pathogenic JUNV strains. Accordingly, the Candid#1-neutralizing VHHs could not neutralize pathogenic JUNV strains, but they could still bind to cells infected with a pathogenic strain or the escape mutant viruses. These results show that the attenuated strains of JUNV can be potently neutralized by nucleoprotein-specific VHHs."

Single domain antibodies (sdAbs), the recombinantly produced variable domains derived from camelid and shark heavy chain antibodies, provide advantages of stability and solubility and can be further engineered to enhance their properties. In this study, we generated sdAbs specific for Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein (GP) and increased their stability to expand their utility for use in austere locals. Ebola virus is extremely virulent and causes fatal hemorrhagic fever in ~\u00a050 percent of the cases. The viral GP binds to host cell receptors to facilitate viral entry and thus plays a critical role in pathogenicity. An immune phage display library containing more than 107 unique clones was developed from a llama immunized with a combination of killed Ebola virus and recombinantly produced GP. We panned the library to obtain GP binding sdAbs and isolated sdAbs from 5 distinct sequence families. Three GP binders with dissociation constants ranging from ~\u00a02 to 20\u00a0nM, and melting temperatures from ~\u00a057 to 72\u00a0\u00b0C were selected for protein engineering in order to increase their stability through a combination of consensus sequence mutagenesis and the addition of a non-canonical disulfide bond. These changes served to increase the melting temperatures of the sdAbs by 15\u201317\u00a0\u00b0C. In addition, fusion of a short positively charged tail to the C-terminus which provided ideal sites for the chemical modification of these sdAbs resulted in improved limits of detection of GP and Ebola virus like particles while serving as tracer antibodies. SdAbs specific for Ebola GP were selected and their stability and functionality were improved utilizing protein engineering. Thermal stability of antibody reagents may be of particular importance when operating in austere locations that lack reliable refrigeration. Future efforts can evaluate the potential of these isolated sdAbs as candidates for diagnostic or therapeutic applications for Ebola."

Camelids produce immunoglobulins G devoid of light chains, in which the antigen recognition domain is called VHH. Given their unique characteristics, VHHs were selected using Phage Display against CTX from Crotalus durissus terrificus. After three rounds of biopanning, four sequence profiles for CB (KF498602, KF498603, KF498604, and KF498605) and one for CA (KF498606) were revealed. All clones presented the VHH hallmark in FR2 and a long CDR3, with the exception of KF498606. After expressing pET22b-VHHs in E. coli, approximately 2 to 6 mg of protein per liter of culture were obtained. When tested for cross-reactivity, VHHs presented specificity for the Crotalus genus and were capable of recognizing CB through Western blot. KF498602 and KF498604 showed thermostability, and displayed affinity constants for CTX in the micro or nanomolar range. They inhibited in vitro CTX PLA2 activity, and CB cytotoxicity. Furthermore, KF498604 inhibited the CTX-induced myotoxicity in mice by 78.8%. Molecular docking revealed that KF498604 interacts with the CA\u2013CB interface of CTX, seeming to block substrate access. Selected VHHs may be alternatives for the crotalic envenoming treatment."

In contrast to humans, MERS-CoV\u2013exposed dromedaries develop only very mild infections and exceptionally potent virus-neutralizing antibody responses. These strong antibody responses may be caused by affinity maturation as a result of repeated exposure to the virus or by the fact that dromedaries\u2014apart from conventional antibodies\u2014have relatively unique, heavy chain\u2013only antibodies (HCAbs). These HCAbs are devoid of light chains and have long complementarity-determining regions with unique epitope binding properties, allowing them to recognize and bind with high affinity to epitopes not recognized by conventional antibodies. Through direct cloning and expression of the variable heavy chains (VHHs) of HCAbs from the bone marrow of MERS-CoV\u2013infected dromedaries, we identified several MERS-CoV\u2013specific VHHs or nanobodies. In vitro, these VHHs efficiently blocked virus entry at picomolar concentrations. The selected VHHs bind with exceptionally high affinity to the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein. Furthermore, camel/human chimeric HCAbs\u2014composed of the camel VHH linked to a human Fc domain lacking the CH1 exon\u2014had an extended half-life in the serum and protected mice against a lethal MERS-CoV challenge.

In order to treat lymphoma, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) can target different antigens, including CD19, CD20 and CD22 on the surface of B-cells. Along with biotechnology progress, a new generation of antibodies is introduced, with the purpose of eliminating the defects of the previous generation. Among the most developed one are nanobodies (Nb).\u00a0 Nbs are a unique kind of camelid single domain antibody fragments with a broad range of medical applications. Unique physicochemical properties of Nbs have made them ideal candidates for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Materials and Methods: An immune gene library was created, and several CD19 specific Nbs were selected through antigen panning process, and their molecular properties as well as specificity, sensitivity, affinity and immunoreactivity against CD19 positive and negative cells were evaluated. Results: The Nb library was prepared with 7.2 x107 members. We managed to isolate a panel of CD19-specific Nbs after the last round of selection with the affinity of isolated Nbs being estimated at the standard range of 15-35 nM.\u00a0 Sequence analysis of positive clones was indicative of the fact that 12 variable sequences were confirmed. Of all these 12 clones, 2 clones with the greatest level signal in ELISA underwent subsequent analysis. Our sequencing results indicated high sequence homology (approximately 90%) between the Nb and Homa variable immunoglobulin domains.Conclusion: Specific Nbs possess the potential to be used as novel therapeutic approaches in order to treat autoimmune diseases and B-cell lymphoma."

The low pH solubilizes root-toxic ionic aluminium (Al3+) species from clay minerals, driving the evolution of counteractive adaptations in cultivated crops. The food crop Sorghum bicolor upregulates the membrane-embedded transporter protein SbMATE in its roots. SbMATE mediates efflux of the anionic form of the organic acid, citrate, into the soil rhizosphere, chelating Al3+ ions and thereby imparting Al-resistance based on excluding Al+3 from the growing root tip. Here, we use electrophysiological, radiolabeled, and fluorescence-based transport assays in two heterologous expression systems to establish a broad substrate recognition profile of SbMATE, showing the proton and/or sodium-driven transport of 14C-citrate anion, as well as the organic monovalent cation, ethidium, but not its divalent analog, propidium. We further complement our transport assays by measuring substrate binding to detergent-purified SbMATE protein. Finally, we use the purified membrane protein as an antigen to discover native conformation-binding and transport function-altering nanobodies using an animal-free, mRNA/cDNA display technology. Our results demonstrate the utility of using Pichia pastoris as an efficient eukaryotic host to express large quantities of functional plant transporter proteins. The nanobody discovery approach is applicable to other non-immunogenic plant proteins."

Immunization with complex mixtures of antigens such as whole organisms and tissue extracts including tumoral ones evokes a highly diverse immune response. During such a response, antibodies are generated against a variety of epitopes in the mixture. Here, we propose a surface display design that is suited to simultaneously identify camelid single domain antibodies and their targets. Immune libraries of single-domain antigen recognition fragments from camelid heavy chain-only antibodies (VHH) were attached to the peptidoglycan of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus employing its endogenous housekeeping sortase enzyme. The sortase transpeptidation reaction covalently attached the VHH to the bacterial peptidoglycan. The reversible nature of the reaction allowed the recovery of the VHH from the bacterial surface and the use of the VHH in downstream applications. These staphylococcal surface display libraries were used to rapidly identify VHH as well as their targets by immunoprecipitation (IP). Our novel bacterial surface display platform was stable under harsh screening conditions, allowed fast target identification, and readily permitted the recovery of the displayed VHH for downstream analysis."

Production of sdAb in conventional manner requires active immunization of Camelidae animal, which is laborious, time consuming, costly and in many cases not feasible (e.g. in case of highly toxic or infectious antigens). In this study, we describe an alternative pipeline that includes in vitro stimulation of na\u00efve alpaca B-lymphocytes by antigen of interest (in this case endothelial cell binding domain of OspA of Borrelia) in the presence of recombinant alpaca interleukins 2 and 4, construction of sdAb phage library, selection of antigen specific sdAb expressed on phages (biopanning) and confirmation of binding ability of sdAb to the antigen. By joining the in vitro immunization and the phage display ten unique phage clones carrying sdAb were selected. Out of ten, seven sdAb showed strong antigen binding ability in phage ELISA. Furthermore, two soluble forms of sdAb were produced and their differential antigen binding affinity was measured with bio-layer interferometry. A proposed pipeline has potential to reduce the cost substantially required for maintenance of camelid herd for active immunization. Furthermore, in vitro immunization can be achieved within a week to enrich mRNA copies encoding antigen-specific sdAbs in B cell. This rapid and cost effective pipeline can help researchers to develop efficiently sdAb for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes."

Nonetheless, a significant number of patients and malignancies do not respond to this therapy. To develop a screen for response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition, it is critical to develop a non-invasive tool to accurately assess dynamic immune checkpoint expression. Here we evaluated non-invasive SPECT/CT imaging of PD-L1 expression, in murine tumor models with varying PD-L1 expression, using high affinity PD-L1-specific nanobodies (Nbs). We generated and characterized 37 Nbs recognizing mouse PD-L1. Among those, four Nbs C3, C7, E2 and E4 were selected and evaluated for preclinical imaging of PD-L1 in syngeneic mice. We performed SPECT/CT imaging in wild type versus PD-L1 knock-out mice, using Technetium-99m ( 99m Tc) labeled Nbs. Nb C3 and E2 showed specific antigen binding and beneficial biodistribution. Through the use of CRISPR/Cas9 PD-L1 knock-out TC-1 lung epithelial cell lines, we demonstrate that SPECT/CT imaging using Nb C3 and E2 identifies PD-L1 expressing tumors, but not PD-L1 non-expressing tumors, thereby confirming the diagnostic potential of the selected Nbs. In conclusion, these data show that Nbs C3 and E2 can be used to non-invasively image PD-L1 levels in the tumor, with the strength of the signal correlating with PD-L1 levels. These findings warrant further research into the use of Nbs as a tool to image inhibitory signals in the tumor environment. "

Following immunization of a llama with the full-length VAR2CSA recombinant protein, we have expressed and characterized a panel of 19 nanobodies able to recognize the recombinant VAR2CSA as well as the surface of erythrocytes infected with parasites originating from different parts of the world. Domain mapping revealed that a large majority of nanobodies targeted DBL1X whereas a few of them were directed towards DBL4\u03b5, DBL5\u03b5 and DBL6\u03b5. One nanobody targeting the DBL1X was able to recognize the native VAR2CSA protein of the three parasite lines tested. Furthermore, four nanobodies targeting DBL1X reproducibly inhibited CSA adhesion of erythrocytes infected with the homologous NF54-CSA parasite strain, providing evidences that DBL1X domain is part or close to the CSA binding site. These nanobodies could serve as useful tools to identify conserved epitopes shared between different variants and to characterize the interactions between VAR2CSA and CSA."

It is triggered by the accumulation of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IE) in the intervillous spaces of the placenta and is associated with foetal growth restriction and maternal anemia. IE accumulation is supported by the binding of the parasite-expressed protein VAR2CSA to placental chondroitin sulfate A (CSA). Defining specific CSA-binding epitopes of VAR2CSA, against which to target the immune response, is essential for the development of a vaccine aimed at blocking IE adhesion. However, the development of a VAR2CSA adhesion-blocking vaccine remains challenging due to (i) the large size of VAR2CSA and (ii) the extensive immune selection for polymorphisms and thereby non-neutralizing B-cell epitopes. Camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies (HcAbs) are known to target epitopes that are less immunogenic to classical IgG and, due to their small size and protruding antigen-binding loop, able to reach and recognize cryptic, conformational epitopes which are inaccessible to conventional antibodies. The variable heavy chain (VHH) domain is the antigen-binding site of camelid HcAbs, the so called Nanobody, which represents the smallest known (15 kDa) intact, native antigen-binding fragment. In this study, we have used the Nanobody technology, an approach new to malaria research, to generate small and functional antibody fragments recognizing unique epitopes broadly distributed on VAR2CSA."

Despite remarkable progress towards an understanding of tumor biology, there is no efficient treatment and patient outcome remains poor. Here, we present a unique anti-proteomic approach for selection of nanobodies specific for overexpressed glioblastoma proteins. A phage-displayed nanobody library was enriched in protein extracts from NCH644 and NCH421K glioblastoma cell lines. Differential ELISA screenings revealed seven nanobodies that target the following antigens: the ACTB/NUCL complex, VIM, NAP1L1, TUFM, DPYSL2, CRMP1, and ALYREF. Western blots showed highest protein up-regulation for ALYREF, CRMP1, and VIM. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis with the OncoFinder software against the complete &ldquo;Cancer Genome Atlas&rdquo; brain tumor gene expression dataset suggests the involvement of different proteins in the WNT and ATM pathways, and in Aurora B, Sem3A, and E-cadherin signaling. We demonstrate the potential use of  NAP1L1 ,  NUCL ,  CRMP1 ,  ACTB , and  VIM  for differentiation between glioblastoma and lower grade gliomas, with  DPYSL2  as a promising &ldquo;glioma  versus  reference&rdquo; biomarker. A small scale validation study confirmed significant changes in mRNA expression levels of  VIM ,  DPYSL2 ,  ACTB  and  TRIM28 . This work helps to fill the information gap in this field by defining novel differences in biochemical profiles between gliomas and reference samples. Thus, selected genes can be used to distinguish glioblastoma from lower grade gliomas, and from reference samples. These findings should be valuable for glioblastoma patients once they are validated on a larger sample size. "

Here, phagemid-transfected E. coli clones producing nanobodies capable of binding to CyaA-Hly were selected from a humanized-camel VH/VHH phage-display library. Subsequently verified for binding activities by indirect ELISA and Western blotting, four CyaA-Hly-specific nanobodies were obtained and designated according to the presence/absence of VHH-hallmark amino acids as VHH2, VH5, VH18 and VHH37. In vitro neutralization assay revealed that all four ~17-kDa His-tagged VH/VHH nanobodies, in particular VHH37, which were over-expressed as inclusions and successfully unfolded-refolded, were able to effectively inhibit CyaA-Hly-mediated hemolysis. Phage-mimotope searching revealed that only peptides with sequence homologous to Linker 1 connecting Blocks I and II within the CyaA-RTX subdomain were able to bind to these four CyaA-Hly-specific nanobodies. Structural analysis of VHH37 via homology modeling and intermolecular docking confirmed that this humanized nanobody directly interacts with CyaA-RTX/Linker 1 through multiple hydrogen and ionic bonds. Altogether, our present data demonstrate that CyaA-RTX/Linker 1 could serve as a potential epitope of CyaA-protective antigen that may be useful for development of peptide-based pertussis vaccines. Additionally, such toxin-specific nanobodies have a potential for test-driven development of a ready-to-use therapeutic in passive immunization for mitigation of disease severity."

It is associated with food poisoning, toxic shock, atopic dermatitis, asthma, and nasal polyps in humans. The current diagnostic methods for staphylococcal enterotoxin are mainly based on traditional monoclonal antibodies which hardly meet the requirements for clinical applications, and hybridoma clones lose their ability to secrete antibodies during time. The present study investigates the development of a novel, highly specific, low-cost, and sensitive nanobody capable of being used in immunoassays for Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) detection in suspicious foods. For this purpose, Camelus dromedarius was immunized against SEB toxin. After obtaining acceptable titration, a high-quality phage display nanobody library (4\u2009\u00d7\u20091010\u00a0PFU/ml) was constructed. High-affinity SEB-specific nanobodies were retrieved from constructed libraries. After phage rescue and five round of biopanning, clone screening was performed by phage ELISA. Recombinant nanobodies which were expressed from C7 and C21 clone showed the highest affinity for SEB. The presence of high quality and pure nanobody band at ~\u200915\u00a0kDa was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. The affinity constant which was measured by ELISA was calculated to be around 10\u22129\u00a0M. The results suggest that the proposed detection method by nanobodies is an alternative diagnostic tool enabling a rapid, inexpensive, and specific detection of the SEB."

Their unique advantageous properties make Nbs highly attractive in various applications. The general approach to obtain Nbs is to isolate them from immune libraries by phage display technology. However, it is unfeasible when the antigens are toxic, lethal, transmissible or of low immunogenicity. Na\u00efve libraries could be an alternative way to solve the above problems. We constructed a large camel na\u00efve phage display Nanobody (Nb) library with great diversity.

These Nbs showed comparable affinity and antigen-binding thermostability at 37\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C compared to the PCT Nbs from an immune phage-displayed library. Furthermore, two PCT Nbs that recognize unique epitopes on PCT have been successfully applied to develop a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect PCT, which showed a linear working range from 10-1000\u00a0ng/mL of PCT. We have constructed a large and diverse na\u00efve phage display Nb library, which potentially functioning as a good resource for selecting antigen-binders with high quality. Moreover, functional Nbs against PCT were successfully characterized and applied, providing great values on medical application."

Disease eradication requires sensitive diagnostic tools and efficient treatment strategies. Immunodiagnostics based on antigen detection are preferable to antibody detection because the latter cannot differentiate between active infection and cure. Classical monoclonal antibodies are inaccessible to cryptic epitopes (based on their size-150 kDa), costly to produce and require cold chain maintenance, a condition that is difficult to achieve in trypanosomiasis endemic regions, which are mostly rural. Nanobodies are recombinant, heat-stable, small-sized (15 kDa), antigen-specific, single-domain, variable fragments derived from heavy chain-only antibodies in camelids. Because of numerous advantages over classical antibodies, we investigated the use of nanobodies for the targeting of trypanosome-specific antigens and diagnostic potential. An alpaca was immunized using lysates of Trypanosoma evansi. Using phage display and bio-panning techniques, a cross-reactive nanobody (Nb392) targeting all trypanosome species and isolates tested was selected. Imunoblotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry assays were combined to identify the target recognized. Nb392 targets paraflagellar rod protein (PFR1) of T. evansi, T. brucei, T. congolense and T. vivax. Two different RNAi mutants with defective PFR assembly (PFR2RNAi and KIF9BRNAi) were used to confirm its specificity. In conclusion, using a complex protein mixture for alpaca immunization, we generated a highly specific nanobody (Nb392) that targets a conserved trypanosome protein, i.e., PFR1 in the flagella of trypanosomes. Nb392 is an excellent marker for the PFR and can be useful in the diagnosis of trypanosomiasis. In addition, as demonstrated, Nb392 can be a useful research or PFR protein isolation tool."

After immunizing a camel with soluble Cry1Ac toxin, a phage displayed library was constructed to generate Nbs against the Cry1Ac toxin.

Failure of current methods to control Campylobacter in broilers stresses the urgency to develop novel mitigation measures. We obtained six nanobodies with a broad specificity, that recognize strains belonging to the two most relevant species, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. The target of the nanobodies was identified as the major outer membrane protein, a porin that contributes to bacterial virulence and viability. Multimerization of the nanobodies led to agglutination of C. jejuni cells, which may affect colonization in the chicken gut.

To address this unmet need, we coupled RNA sequencing of human pancreatic islets to a systems biology approach to identify new biomarkers of the endocrine pancreas. Dipeptidyl-Peptidase 6 (DPP6) was identified as a target whose mRNA expression is at least 25-fold higher in human pancreatic islets as compared to surrounding tissues and is not changed by proinflammatory cytokines. At the protein level, DPP6 localizes only in beta and alpha cells within the pancreas. We next generated a high-affinity camelid single-domain antibody (nanobody) targeting human DPP6. The nanobody was radiolabelled and in vivo SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution studies were performed in immunodeficient mice that were either transplanted with DPP6-expressing Kelly neuroblastoma cells or insulin-producing human EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells. The human DPP6-expressing cells were clearly visualized in both models. In conclusion, we have identified a novel beta and alpha cell biomarker and developed a tracer for in vivo imaging of human insulin secreting cells.

The prognosis for patients remains poor, despite the combination of new preoperative and intraoperative neuroimaging, radical surgery, and recent advances in radiotherapy and chemotherapy. To improve GBM therapy and patient outcome, sustained drug delivery to glioma cells is needed, while minimizing toxicity to adjacent neurons and glia cells. This might be achieved through an anti-proteomic approach based on nanobodies, the single-domain antigen-binding fragments of heavy-chain antibodies of the camelid adaptive immune system. We report here on the validation and quantification of a nanobody raised against mitochondrial translation elongation factor (TUFM). Differential expression of TUFM was examined in different GBM cell lines and GBM tissue at the protein and mRNA levels, as compared to their expression in neural stem cells and normal brain tissue. We further used  in-silico  modelling and immunocytochemistry to define the specificity of anti-TUFM nanobody (Nb206) towards GBM stem cells, as compared to GBM cell lines (U251MG and U87MG cells). Due to its specificity and pronounced inhibitory effect on GBM stem cell growth, we propose the use of this anti-TUFM nanobody for GBM  in vitro  immunoimaging and potentially also cancer stem cell targeting.

To date there is no approach available to study endogenous vimentin in a physiological context. Here, we describe the selection and targeted modification of novel single-domain antibodies, so-called nanobodies, to trace vimentin in various cellular assays. Most importantly, we generated vimentin chromobodies by combining the binding moieties of the nanobodies with fluorescent proteins. Following chromobody fluorescence in a cancer-relevant cellular model, we were able for the first time to monitor and quantify dynamic changes of endogenous vimentin upon siRNA-mediated knockdown, induction with TGF-\u03b2 and modification with Withaferin A by high-content imaging. This versatile approach allows detailed studies of the spatiotemporal organization of vimentin in living cells. It enables the identification of vimentin-modulating compounds, thereby providing the basis to screen for novel therapeutics affecting EMT."

Nanobodies are the smallest intact antigen binding fragments derived from heavy chain-only antibodies (HCAbs) occurring in camelids. They are produced as recombinant proteins in E. coli and have different biotechnological applications, including the detection and purification of their specific antigens. To produce anti-sfGFP specific nanobodies, an adult one-humped camel was successfully immunized and immune response was evaluated by ELISA, which showed an active participation of HCAbs in this response. A relatively large nanobody \u201cimmune\u201d library of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108 individual transformants, with 87.5\u00a0% positivity, was prepared from the blood of the immunized camel. Phage display biopanning on this nanobody library resulted in the isolation of seven anti-sfGFP specific nanobodies, referred to as NbsfGFP01, 02, 03, 04, 06, 07 and 08. These nanobodies were able to recognize sfGFP tag as free or in fusion with growth hormone in ELISA and immuno-blotting. Furthermore, they showed important apparent affinities in the detection and capture of sfGFP by ELISA, and they targeted three different epitopes on the surface of their antigen. The interesting characteristics of these molecular binders make them valuable tools for more in-depth structural and functional studies related to sfGFP fusion proteins."

The aim of this work was to isolate and characterize a human signal domain antibody against VEGFR-2 domain3 (VEGFR D3) from a phage display library. To produce antigen-specific recombinant nanobodies with high affinity to VEGFR2 D3, a liquid phase panning strategy was used for all rounds of panning. For nanobody expression and purification, four VEGFR2 D3-blocking clones were subcloned into a pETduet-biotin-MBP expression vector. The recombinant proteins carried an MBP tag to facilitate purification by affinity chromatography. Recombinant NTV(1\u20134) was obtained after an additional gel filtration chromatography step. The interactions between VEGFR2 D3 and NTV(1\u20134) were assessed with luminescence-based AlphaScreen assay and SPR assay. Anti-angiogenesis effects were examined in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In the AlphaScreen assay, NTV1 (100 and 200 nmol/L) elicited the highest binding signal with VEGFR2 D3; NTV2 showed moderate interactions with VEGFR2 D3; NTV3 and NTV4 exhibited little or no interaction with VEGFR2 D3. In the SPR assay, NTV1 displayed a high affinity for VEGFR2 D3 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 49\u00b11.8 nmol/L. NTV1 (1\u20131000 nmol/L) dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of HUVECs and the endothelial tube formation by the HUVECs. The nanobody NTV1 is a potential therapeutic candidate for blocking VEGFR2. This study provides a novel and promising strategy for development of VEGFR2-targeted nanobody-based cancer therapeutics."

The crystal structure of the LEDGF-VH complex reveals that the single domain antibody mimics the effect of binding of HIV integrase to LEDGF which is crucial for HIV propagation. CD4-expressing T cell lines were constructed to constitutively express the LEDGF-binding VH and these cells showed interference with HIV viral replication, assayed by virus capsid protein p24 production. Therefore, pre-conditioning cells to express antibody fragments confers effective intracellular immunization for preventing chronic viral replication and can be a way to prevent HIV spread in infected patients. This raises the prospect that intracellular immunization strategies that focus on cellular components of viral integrase protein interactions can be used to combat the problems associated with latent HIV virus re-emergence in patients. New genome editing development, such as using CRISPR/cas9, offer the prospect intracellularly immunized T cells in HIV+ patients."

Here we present a modular strategy to create functional cell-permeable nanobodies capable of targeted labelling and manipulation of intracellular antigens in living cells. The cell-permeable nanobodies are formed by the site-specific attachment of intracellularly stable (or cleavable) cyclic arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides to camelid-derived single-chain VHH antibody fragments. We used this strategy for the non-endocytic delivery of two recombinant nanobodies into living cells, which enabled the relocalization of the polymerase clamp PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and tumour suppressor p53 to the nucleolus, and thereby allowed the detection of protein\u2013protein interactions that involve these two proteins in living cells. Furthermore, cell-permeable nanobodies permitted the co-transport of therapeutically relevant proteins, such as Mecp2, into the cells. This technology constitutes a major step in the labelling, delivery and targeted manipulation of intracellular antigens. Ultimately, this approach opens the door towards immunostaining in living cells and the expansion of immunotherapies to intracellular antigen targets. Delivery of antibodies into living cells enables the labelling and manipulation of intracellular antigens; however, transporting antibodies into the cytosol in a functional state is difficult. Now, a modular strategy for creating cell-permeable nanobodies capable of targeting intracellular antigens has been developed.

Grade IV astrocytoma, known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is a highly lethal disease where the standard therapies of surgery, followed by radiation and chemotherapy, cannot significantly prolong the life expectancy of the patients. Tumour recurrence shows more aggressive form compared to the primary tumour, and results in patient survival from 12 to 15 months only. Although still controversial, the cancer stem cell hypothesis postulates that cancer stem cells are responsible for early relapse of the disease after surgical intervention due to their high resistance to therapy. Alternative strategies for GBM therapy are thus urgently needed. Nanobodies are single-domain antigen-binding fragments of heavy-chain antibodies, and together with classical antibodies, they are part of the camelid immune system. Nanobodies are small and stable, and they share a high degree of sequence identity to the human heavy chain variable domain, and these characteristics offer them advantages over classical antibodies or antibody fragments. We first immunised an alpaca with a human GBM stem-like cell line prepared from primary GBM cultures. Next, a nanobody library was constructed in a phage-display vector. Using nanobody phage-display technology, we selected specific GBM stem-like cell binders through a number of affinity selections, using whole cell protein extracts and membrane protein-enriched extracts from eight different GBM patients, and membrane protein-enriched extracts from two established GBM stem-like cell lines (NCH644 and NCH421K cells). After the enrichment, periplasmic extract ELISA was used to screen for specific clones. These nanobody clones were recloned into the pHEN6 vector, expressed in Escherichia coli WK6, and purified using immobilised metal affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. Specific nanobody:antigen pairs were obtained and mass spectrometry analysis revealed two proteins, TRIM28 and \u03b2-actin, that were up-regulated in the GBM stem-like cells compared to the controls."

Interruption of CD47\u2013SIRP\u03b1 interactions in immunodeficient mice bearing human tumors enhances therapeutic antitumor antibody responses by promoting phagocytosis of antibody-bound tumor cells. Here, we use a novel anti-CD47 single domain antibody, derived from an alpaca, in an immunocompetent mouse model of melanoma and find that, in contrast to immunodeficient models, CD47 blockade alone is insufficient to enhance the effects of antimelanoma antibodies. However, when combined with blockade of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), an immune receptor that inhibits antitumor T cell responses, we find synergistic activity, suggesting a role for both innate and adaptive inhibitory pathways in the response to therapeutic antibodies."

The identification of target tumor cells through a specific antigen enriched on their surface and the subsequent delivery of the therapeutic agent only to those cells requires, besides the efficacy of the therapeutic agent itself, the identification of an antigen enriched on the surface of tumor cells, the generation of high affinity antibodies against that antigen. We have generated single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) against the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv10.1, which outside of the brain is detectable almost exclusively in tumor cells. The nanobody with highest affinity was fused to an improved form of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand TRAIL, to target this cytokine to the surface of tumor cells. The resulting construct, VHH-D9-scTRAIL, shows rapid and strong apoptosis induction in different tumor models in cell culture. The construct combines two sources of specificity, the expression of the antigen restricted to tumor cells and the tumor selectivity of TRAIL. Such specificity combined with the high affinity obtained through nanobodies make the novel agent a promising concept for cancer therapy."

Nanobodies are single-domain antibodies derived from the variable regions of Camelidae atypical immunoglobulins. They show promise as high-affinity reagents for research, diagnostics and therapeutics owing to their high specificity, small size (\u223c15 kDa) and straightforward bacterial expression. However, identification of repertoires with sufficiently high affinity has proven time consuming and difficult, hampering nanobody implementation. Our approach generates large repertoires of readily expressible recombinant nanobodies with high affinities and specificities against a given antigen. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through the production of large repertoires of nanobodies against two antigens, GFP and mCherry, with Kd values into the subnanomolar range. After mapping diverse epitopes on GFP, we were also able to design ultrahigh-affinity dimeric nanobodies with Kd values as low as \u223c30 pM.

Consequently, trypanosome surface antigen-specific immunoglobulins in the absence of complement are non-trypanocidal. In contrast, certain monovalent nanobodies (Nb), monomeric antigen-binding domains derived from camelid Heavy-Chain Antibodies (HCAb) and which have a much lower molecular weight (15 kDa) than classical antibodies (150 kDa), efficiently lyse trypanosomes both in vitro and in vivo. This is surprising as classically immunoglobulin effector functions are mediated via the Fc-domain, which is absent from the Nb. We demonstrate that the Nb-mediated trypanolysis depends on the low molecular weight, monovalency and high affinity and is associated with loss of motility, a major block to endocytosis, energy depletion and cell death. Overall, targeting the parasite surface with low molecular weight, high affinity Nbs is sufficient to exert a direct therapeutic action. Therefore, the exploitation of Nbs against African trypanosomiasis represents a novel therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, demonstration that a high affinity antigen-binding Nb or Fab fragment lacking an effector domain (i.e., Fc-domain or an attached toxin) can exert a direct biological function, suggests that intact antibodies likely harbour latent functionality which only become revealed upon removal of the Fc-domain."

By contrast, single-domain antibodies called nanobodies can be produced in bacteria or yeast, and their stability may enable aerosol delivery. Two papers now report nanobodies that bind tightly to spike and efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in cells. Schoof et al. screened a yeast surface display of synthetic nanobodies and Xiang et al. screened anti-spike nanobodies produced by a llama. Both groups identified highly potent nanobodies that lock the spike protein in an inactive conformation. Multivalent constructs of selected nanobodies achieved even more potent neutralization.\n\nScience , this issue p. [1473][1], p. [1479][2]\n\nCost-effective, efficacious therapeutics are urgently needed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we used camelid immunization and proteomics to identify a large repertoire of highly potent neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). We discovered Nbs with picomolar to femtomolar affinities that inhibit viral infection at concentrations below the nanograms-per-milliliter level, and we determined a structure of one of the most potent Nbs in complex with the RBD. Structural proteomics and integrative modeling revealed multiple distinct and nonoverlapping epitopes and indicated an array of potential neutralization mechanisms. We bioengineered multivalent Nb constructs that achieved ultrahigh neutralization potency (half-maximal inhibitory concentration as low as 0.058 ng/ml) and may prevent mutational escape. These thermostable Nbs can be rapidly produced in bulk from microbes and resist lyophilization and aerosolization.\n\n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abe3255\n [2]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abe4747"

Receptor binding pockets of NadA are localized on the globular head domain (A33 to K69) and the first coiled-coil domain (L121 to K158). Here, the phage display was used to develop a variable heavy chain domain (VHH) that can block receptor binding sites of recombinant NadA (rec-NadA). A phage library displaying VHH was panned against synthetic peptides (NadA-gdA33\u2212K69 or NadA-ccL121\u2212K158), gene encoding VHH was amplified from bound phages and re-cloned in the expression vector, and the soluble VHHs containing disulfide bonds were overexpressed in the SHuffle E. coli. From the repertoire of 96 clones, two VHHs (VHHF3\u2013binding NadA-gdA33\u2212K69 and VHHG9\u2013binding NadA-ccL121\u2212K158) were finally selected as they abrogated the interaction between rec-NadA and the cell receptor. Preincubation of NM with VHHF3 and VHHG9 significantly reduced the adhesion of NM on hBMECs in situ and hindered the traversal of NM across the in-vitro BBB model. The work presents a phage display pipeline with a single-round of panning to select receptor blocking VHHs. It also demonstrates the production of soluble and functional VHHs, which blocked the interaction between NadA and its receptor, decreased adhesion of NM on hBMECs, and reduced translocation of NM across BBB in-vitr..."
